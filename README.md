# Selenium::Remote::Driver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gempesaw/Selenium-Remote-Driver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gempesaw/Selenium-Remote-Driver)

[Selenium WebDriver][wd] is a test tool that allows you to write
automated web application UI tests in any programming language against
any HTTP website using any mainstream JavaScript-enabled browser. This
module is a Perl implementation of the client for the Webdriver
[JSONWireProtocol that Selenium provides.][jsonwire]

This module sends commands directly to the server using HTTP. Using
this module together with the Selenium Server, you can automatically
control any supported browser.

[standalone]: http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

## Installation

It's probably easiest to use the `cpanm` or `CPAN` commands:

```bash
$ cpanm Selenium::Remote::Driver
```

If you want to install from this repository, you have a few options;
see the [installation docs][] for more details.

[installation docs]: /INSTALL.md

## Usage

You can either use this module with the standalone java server, or use
it to directly start the webdriver binaries for you. Note that the
latter option does _not_ require the JRE/JDK to be installed, nor does
it require the selenium standalone server (despite the name of the
main module!).

### with a standalone server

Download the standalone server and have it running on port 4444:

    $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-X.XX.X.jar

Then the following should start up Firefox for you:

#### Locally

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Selenium::Remote::Driver;

my $driver = Selenium::Remote::Driver->new;
$driver->get('http://www.google.com');
print $driver->get_title . "\n"; # "Google"

my $query = $driver->find_element('q', 'name');
$query->send_keys('CPAN Selenium Remote Driver');

my $send_search = $driver->find_element('btnG', 'name');
$send_search->click;

# make the find_element blocking for a second to allow the title to change
$driver->set_implicit_wait_timeout(2000);
my $results = $driver->find_element('search', 'id');

print $driver->get_title . "\n"; # CPAN Selenium Remote Driver - Google Search
$driver->quit;
```

#### Saucelabs

If using Saucelabs, there's no need to have the standalone server
running on a local port, since Saucelabs provides it.

```perl
use Selenium::Remote::Driver;

my $user = $ENV{SAUCE_USERNAME};
my $key = $ENV{SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY};

my $driver = Selenium::Remote::Driver->new(
    remote_server_addr => $user . ':' . $key . '@ondemand.saucelabs.com',
    port => 80
);

$driver->get('http://www.google.com');
print $driver->get_title();
$driver->quit();
```

There are additional usage examples on [metacpan][meta], and also
[in this project's wiki][wiki], including
[setting up the standalone server][setup], running tests on
[Internet Explorer][ie], [Chrome][chrome], [PhantomJS][pjs], and other
useful [example snippets][ex].

### no standalone server

- _Firefox_: simply have the browser installed in the normal place
for your OS.

- _Chrome_: install the Chrome browser, [download Chromedriver][dcd]
and get `chromedriver` in your `$PATH`:

- _PhantomJS_: install the PhantomJS binary and get `phantomjs` in
  your `$PATH`

As long as the proper binary is available in your path, you should be
able to do the following:

```perl
my $firefox = Selenium::Firefox->new;
$firefox->get('http://www.google.com');

my $chrome = Selenium::Chrome->new;
$chrome->get('http://www.google.com');

my $ghost = Selenium::PhantomJS->new;
$ghost->get('http://www.google.com');
```

Note that you can also pass a `binary` argument to any of the above
classes to manually specify what binary to start:

```perl
my $chrome = Selenium::Chrome->new(binary => '~/Downloads/chromedriver');
```

See the pod for the different modules for more details.

## Support and Documentation

There is a mailing list available at

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-remote-driver

for usage questions and ensuing discussions. If you've come across a
bug, please open an issue in the [Github issue tracker][issue]. The
POD is available in the usual places, including [metacpan][meta], and
in your shell via `perldoc`.

```bash
$ perldoc Selenium::Remote::Driver
$ perldoc Selenium::Remote::WebElement
```
